# REST APIs with Flask and Python 
Welcome to my personal repository showcasing the skills I gained through the "REST APIs with Flask and Python" course by Jose Salvatierra, Founder of Teclado and a Software Engineer on Udemy. As a fellow learner, I'm excited to share my journey and the projects I've developed during this comprehensive course.

## üìö What I've Learned:

- Successfully connected web and mobile applications to databases and servers using REST APIs.
- Created secure and reliable REST APIs with advanced features, including authentication, deployments, and database migrations.
- Gained insights into the different layers of a web server and how web applications interact.
- Implemented seamless user authentication, incorporating advanced features like token refresh.
- Managed log-outs effectively and prevented abuse in REST APIs using JWT blacklisting.
- Developed professional-grade REST APIs with expert instruction.
- Optimized the performance of REST APIs using task queues and background workers.

## üë©‚Äçüíª My Journey Through the Course:

The course began with a Python refresher, covering basics to advanced features, ensuring a strong foundation. Jose's guidance led me to create resource-based, production-ready REST APIs using Flask and popular extensions like Flask-Smorest, Flask-JWT-Extended, and Flask-SQLAlchemy.

We delved into essential technologies such as Git and database migrations with Alembic, and explored deployment strategies for Flask REST APIs. Docker was introduced to simplify running and deploying our REST APIs, providing a real-world, industry-relevant experience.

## üéØ Achievements:

- Created resource-based, production-ready REST APIs using Python, Flask, and popular Flask extensions.
- Successfully handled secure user registration and authentication with Flask.
- Efficiently stored resources to a database using SQLAlchemy and Flask-SQLAlchemy.
- Mastered the complex intricacies of deploying Flask REST APIs.
- Simplified running and deploying REST APIs using Docker.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About REST APIs:

A REST API is an application that accepts data from clients and returns data back. Throughout the course, we focused on developing REST APIs for web and mobile applications, providing skills that extend beyond traditional website development.
